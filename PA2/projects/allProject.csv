Many studies on racial issues lack a clear theoretical explanation of racial and political relations.    2. The intrinsic motivation of American racial order  the interaction between them  and the relationship with other aspects of American political life are often so important that the question of what role a race might play should always be part of political science.    3. The failure of political scientists to adequately address racial issues in scholarships is largely a part of the failure of Americans to adequately address racial issues in their common lives.    link: [https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/american-political-science-review/article/racial-orders-in-american-political-development/78C4115EFEB5159EAE76D558D7D86CCB/core-reader](url)      "

"Add `page` generator",37884,open,2019-12-04T17:54:46Z,jonathanhefner,1,66,0,3,Null,"The `page` generator generates one-off pages in an idiomatic way.  Specifically  a one-off page will have a corresponding route and a dedicated controller with `index` action and view.    ---    I often see questions about the best practice for adding an e.g. \"About Us\" page to a Rails app.  Many answers recommend using a single controller with one or more non-REST action.  Some answers even recommend additional gems to manage one-off pages.    The `page` generator establishes and encourages a convention for one-off pages based on DHH's recommendations from a [podcast](http://www.fullstackradio.com/32) ([transcript of relevant portion](http://jeromedalbert.com/how-dhh-organizes-his-rails-controllers/)).  For example  `rails generate page about` will generate the `/about` route  `AboutController` with `index` action  index view  and integration tests.    (As a point of clarity  the `page` generator differs from the `controller` generator in that the `controller` generator generates routes as `/#{controller}/#{action}`  with tests to match.  So `rails generate controller about index` will generate an `/about/index` route and a test that invokes `about_index_url`.)    The `page` generator also provides a `--root` option to generate the root route.  For example  `rails generate page home --root` will additionally draw the `/` route to `HomeController#index`.

"Hide internal utility methods in the public API doc [ci skip]",37878,closed,2019-12-04T09:50:23Z,kamipo,1,3,3,1,2019-12-04T13:49:34Z,"I digged the history for the internal utility methods (`convert_key`   `convert_value`  and `set_defaults`)  I believe it is apparently not  intended to appear them in the public API doc.    * `convert_key`  `convert_value`: 71742114  * `set_defaults`: #20828    https://api.rubyonrails.org/v6.0.1/classes/ActiveSupport/HashWithIndifferentAccess.html    Since we sometimes makes breaking change for internal methods (e.g.  #37870)  so that methods should not be leaked to the public API doc."
"Remove deprecated non-symbol access to nested config_for hashes",37876,closed,2019-12-03T21:54:20Z,etiennebarrie,1,44,171,4,2019-12-04T16:46:23Z,"### Summary    This fixes an issue with #37870 where nested hashes returned by `config_for` could return Hash subclasses instead of strictly a Hash when calling `to_hash`.    Since we changed the name of the `for` option in HashWithIndifferentAccess  and the class dealing with deprecations takes an options hash  there's no exception but the option is silently ignored  which in turn changes the behavior of `HashWithIndifferentAccess#to_hash`.    Instead of fixing the code  this removes the deprecation code  which also solves the issue.    ```ruby  # before #37870   Rails.application.config_for(:example)[:a_hash].to_hash[:other_hash]['key'] # => nil    # after #37870   Rails.application.config_for(:example)[:a_hash].to_hash[:other_hash]['key']  # DEPRECATION WARNING: Accessing hashes returned from config_for by non-symbol keys is deprecated and will be removed in Rails 6.1. Use symbols for access instead. (called from <main> at (pry):1)  # => \"value\"    # after this PR  Rails.application.config_for(:example)[:a_hash].to_hash[:other_hash]['key'] # => nil  ```    ### Other Information    I used the `symbolize_names` option `YAML.load`  which seems to be the first usage of it in Rails. This required me to symbolize the environment name  and the `\"shared\"` special key.  Another possibility would be to use `deep_symbolize_keys` as was done before #35198  but since we're loading the configuration file ourselves  it felt like an unnecessary traversal of the whole data structure. Let me know if that was a mistake.    @rafaelfranca  cc @byroot @Edouard-chin @paracycle @Morriar"
"Deprecate `database` kwarg from `connected_to` without replacement",37874,closed,2019-12-03T20:28:47Z,eileencodes,1,39,53,3,2019-12-04T17:08:02Z,"The `database` kwarg in `connected_to` has resulted in a lot of bug  reports that are trying to use it for sharding when that's not the  intent of the key. After considering where the database kwarg is used in  tests and thinking about usecases for it  we've determined it should be  removed.    There are plans to add sharding support and in the mean time the  database kwarg isn't the right solution for that. Applications that need  to create new connections can use establish_connection or connects_to.  Since the database key causes new connections to be established on every  call  that causes bugs if connected_to with a database kwarg is used  during a request or for any connection that's not a one-off.

"Fix bug in configs_for",37873,closed,2019-12-03T19:38:58Z,eileencodes,1,23,9,2,2019-12-03T21:16:25Z,"If a spec name was provided without an env name  config_for would return  the first config that matched the spec  regardless of environment name.    Now configs_for will return the database config that matches the  default env and requested spec name.    Additionally this commit has moved the default env call into a method  because I'm tired of typing so many lines every single time.    We considered either returning all configs that match that spec name or  raising an error if only spec was passed  but this change has the least  impact on current behavior and matches Active Record's assumptions: that  if you ask for configs it will always consider the current environment.

"Add support for conditional values to TagBuilder",37872,closed,2019-12-03T18:32:23Z,joelhawksley,3,93,1,3,2019-12-04T19:50:55Z,"This PR adds support for conditional values to TagBuilder   extracting logic we use in the GitHub application   inspired by https://github.com/JedWatson/classnames.

"Avoid allocating Binding instance in HWIA#convert_value",37870,closed,2019-12-03T16:44:24Z,casperisfine,1,4,6,1,2019-12-03T17:22:41Z,"`ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess#convert_value` appeared quite high in some production profile so I took a look and found that weird `binding` access.    Digging into the git history to figure the reason  it seems it originate from https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36758 and then https://github.com/rails/rails/commit/64a430129fbec2320054a8fc85672994f38a9ee0    The initial goal was to reduce the allocation in that hotspot by using keyword arguments. But since `for` is a keyword  `binding.get_local_variable` was used as a workaround.     However `binding` does allocate a new `Binding` instance on each invocation  and is a quite slow method.    But since `convert_value` is a private method  I think we can simply rename the argument  and avoid all of that.    I adapted the benchmark from https://github.com/rails/rails/pull/36758:     ```ruby  require 'bundler/inline'    gemfile(true) do    source 'https://rubygems.org'    gem 'activesupport'    gem 'benchmark-ips'    gem 'memory_profiler'  end    require 'active_support/all'    class OptimizedHashWithIndifferentAccess < ActiveSupport::HashWithIndifferentAccess    private      EMPTY_HASH = {}.freeze      # Convert to a regular hash with string keys.    def to_hash      _new_hash = Hash.new      set_defaults(_new_hash)        each do |key  value|        _new_hash[key] = convert_value(value  conversion: :to_hash)      end      _new_hash    end        def []=(key  value)      regular_writer(convert_key(key)  convert_value(value  conversion: :assignment))    end        def convert_value(value  conversion: nil) # :doc:      if value.is_a?
